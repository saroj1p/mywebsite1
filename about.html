  <p> am  Saroj Poudyal, a recent Ph.D. graduate from the Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM), Chennai, India.
My research specializes in the optoelectronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors and van der Waals heterostructures, with a particular focus on excitonic phenomena, nanofabrication, and electrical transport in low-dimensional materials. I also work on low-power memristive devices aimed at advancing quantum technologies and bio-inspired computing.
My broader goal is to contribute to the development of scalable, next-generation electronic and optoelectronic systems using atomically thin materials.</p>
